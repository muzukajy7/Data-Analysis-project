# Process
- Data Collection: Downloaded the bike sales dataset from internet in order to collect all the required data points such as sale dates, customer demographics, categories of bikes, and revenue figures.

- Data Cleaning: The dataset is cleaned up by removing duplicate rows, handling missing values, standardizing date and numeric formats, and categorizing columns for analysis. Each transformation has been commented on to show what has been done and why.

- Data Analysis: The exploratory data analysis included the use of Excel pivot tables to analyze the bikes' sales by model, customer demographics, and regions.
Metrics Computed: It was further used to calculate the total revenue, average sale per customer, top-selling models, and identification of the sales trends over time.
Seasonal Trends: Month-over-month sales were analyzed and visualized in order to help define high and low seasons.
Data Visualization: Charts created in Excel include line, bar, and pie charts that visually present such insights as the best-selling product by revenue, sales by region, and revenue over time.

- Summary of Insights: Summarized key findings regarding popular bike models, demographic preferences, seasonal trends, and other relevant aspects to support inventory management and marketing strategies.
